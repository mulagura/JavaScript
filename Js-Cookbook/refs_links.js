   https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-the-difference-between-declaring-a-variable-and-initializing-a-variable

//    assigning: throwing away the old value of a variable and replacing it with a new one
//
// initialization / definition: it's a special kind of assignment: the first. Before initialization objects have null value and primitive types
//                 have default values such as 0 or false. Can be done in conjunction with declaration.
//
// declaration: a declaration states the type of a variable, along with its name. A variable can be declared only once.
//              It is used by the compiler to help programmers avoid mistakes such as assigning string values to integer variables.
//              Before reading or assigning a variable, that variable must have been declared.

//undefined
  if you declare a variable but not assigned then its value is undefined of type undefined.

//null
    typeof null === 'object'; // This stands since the beginning of JavaScript
    A "fix" was proposed for ECMAScript (via an opt-in). It would have resulted in:

    typeof null === 'null'
    ... but this change was rejected, due to issues with code using this specific "quirk" to test for null.
