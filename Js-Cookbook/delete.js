// delete

// The delete keyword deletes both the value of the property and the property itself.
// The delete operator is designed to be used on object properties. 
  //It has no effect on variables or functions.
// The delete operator should not be used on predefined JavaScript object properties.
   //It can crash your application.  

// When you delete an array element, the array length is not affected. 
   //This holds even if you delete the last element of the array.
